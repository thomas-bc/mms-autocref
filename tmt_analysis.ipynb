      "<span xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The <i>primary input </i>to the system is the light from celestial objects under investigation (i.e. science targets) after it has passed through the atmosphere of the Earth. This light is sometimes known as the science beam (or beams if multiple sub-field-of-views are observed simultaneously). When passing through the atmosphere, the wavefront of the original science beam is distorted by time-variable refractive index changes caused by turbulence at various elevations above the surface of the Earth.<br/>The <i>secondary input </i>to the system is the light from celestial sources located near the science beam on the celestial sphere. These sources are called natural guide stars (NGS) and are used for two purposes: (i) to measure telescope tracking errors and misalignments, as well as (ii) to measure atmospheric wavefront distortion so that the effect of these distortions can be removed from the science beam.<br/>Since suitable NGS may not be present near all desired science targets, the observatory will generate artificial guide stars to measure atmospheric turbulence.<br/>The input light interface is above the observatory, where the air flow disturbance and thermal effects of the observatory buildings become negligible.<br/>The <i>tertiary input </i>to the system is a science observation request. This observation request defines what science target(s) to observe, what guide stars to use, how to configure the system for that observation, and how long to collect photons from the science target(s). In classical observing, such a request may be developed in near-real time by an on-site PI assigned a specific time window by fiat or by a time allocation committee. When queue (dynamic) scheduling is used, such requests are generated in advance and executed in order of scientific priority when the system configuration, weather, and atmospheric conditions are suitable.<br/>Various <i>auxiliary inputs </i>are required for setting operating conditions and evaluate data collected, including universal time, local weather and atmospheric (seeing) conditions and system readiness. For safety reasons, information about work on or near the telescope is needed as well as information about the presence of aircraft in the observatory air space.</span></body></html>\n",

As part of the alignment process APS will have the capability to phase the 492 M1 segments. APS will use starlight to measure the wavefront errors and then will determine the appropriate corrections to align the optics.  <br/>The APS will align the telescope at various elevation angles and then from the set points for the M1, M2 and M3 control systems, lookup tables will be generated to correct for gravity-induced deformations. In a similar fashion, data will be collected at various temperatures over time and lookup tables will be built as a function of temperature as well. APS is not responsible for the generation of the LUTs.<br/>APS includes all the necessary hardware, software, and interfaces (to the TCS; and M1, M2, and M3 control systems) required to accomplish the alignment tasks defined above.<br/>APS will have an acquisition camera with a 1 to 2 arcminute field of view which can be used for telescope pointing, acquisition, and tracking tests.
